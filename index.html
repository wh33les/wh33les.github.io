				<p style="margin-top:0px">Welcome to my website!</p>
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am a trained mathematician working on a career change out of academia.</p>
				<p>I enjoy knitting and sewing, rollerskating, learning to play bridge, and going to breweries.  <!--I also enjoy working as a background actor in movies and TV shows that are filmed in the Atlanta metropolitan area.--></p>
				<p>I am originally from Colorado Springs, but I grew up in a military family and we moved a lot.  I've also moved around a lot as an adult <!--Growing up I lived in Colorado, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Germany, and Kansas.  As an adult I have moved around a lot, too--> -- in fact, this is why I created this website!  Whenever a contract ends and I switch jobs, it's not clear whether or not my professional website remains.  Here is a permanent hub for all of my materials.</p>
				<p>I just finished up a one year contract at Centre College in Danville, KY.  Thus, I'm on the market for a new job!  <b><a href="WarrenAshleyresume2024.pdf">Here is my resum&eacute;.</a></b>  For the past year and a half I have been preparing for a career in machine learning, data analysis, or web development.  I am also interested in quantitative research and statistics positions.</p>

		<h2>About this site</h2>
		<p>The Coding link at the top is about my coding experience, and is meant to supplement my resum&eacute;.</p>
		<p>The Academia link gives an overview of two aspects of my experience in academia, teaching and research.  It's also a showcase of materials I've produced over the years during my time in academia.</p>
		<p>Finally, the third part, Links, compiles some of the more important links that are scattered throughout the site, mainly it has all my projects gathered in one place.</p>
