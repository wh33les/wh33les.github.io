				<p style="margin-top:0px">Welcome to my website!</p>
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am a trained mathematician working on a career change from academia to industry.</p>
				<p>I enjoy knitting and sewing, rollerskating, learning to play bridge, and going to breweries.  <!--I also enjoy working as a background actor in movies and TV shows that are filmed in the Atlanta metropolitan area.--></p>
				<p>I am originally from Colorado Springs, but I grew up in a military family and we moved a lot.  Growing up I lived in Colorado, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Germany, and Kansas.  As an adult I have moved around a lot, too -- in fact, this is why I created this website!  Whenever a contract ends and I switch jobs, it's not clear whether or not my professional website remains.  Here is a permanent hub for all of my materials.</p>
				<!--<p>For now, <a href="https://wheeler.math.gatech.edu" target="_blank">here</a> is my professional website.  My contract is ending this year (2023), so it might only be available for a limited time.</p>-->
				<p>I am currently teaching at Centre College in Danville, KY for a one year contract.  Thus, I'm on the market for a new job, starting summer 2024!  <b>Here is my <a href="resume2023.pdf" target="_blank">resum&eacute;</a> and my <a href="WheelerCV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.</b>  Right now I am exploring different opportunities, but for the past year or so I have been preparing for a career in data science.</p>

				<h2>About this site</h2>
				<p>I've got this site divided into three parts, linked above under my name.</p>
				<p>The first part, Coding, is about my coding experience, and is meant to supplement my resum√©.  Since I've been looking at a career in data science, I thought this should be the most important part of this website.</p>
				<p>The second part, Academia, gives an overview of two aspects of my experience in academia, teaching and research.  It's also a showcase of materials I've produced over the years during my time in academia.</p>
				<p>Finally, the third part, Links, compiles some of the more important links that are scattered throughout the site, along with a few other links that I thought would be interesting.</p>
