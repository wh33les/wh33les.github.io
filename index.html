				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am a trained mathematician working on a career change from academia to industry.</p>
				<p>I enjoy knitting and sewing, rollerskating, learning to play bridge, and going to breweries.  <!--I also enjoy working as a background actor in movies and TV shows that are filmed in the Atlanta metropolitan area.--></p>
				<p>I am originally from Colorado Springs, but I grew up in a military family and we moved a lot.  Growing up I lived in Colorado, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Germany, and Kansas.  As an adult I have moved around a lot, too -- in fact, this is why I created this website!  Whenever a contract ends and I switch jobs, it's not clear whether or not my professional website remains.  Here is a permanent hub for all of my materials.</p>
				<!--<p>For now, <a href="https://wheeler.math.gatech.edu" target="_blank">here</a> is my professional website.  My contract is ending this year (2023), so it might only be available for a limited time.</p>-->
				<p>I am currently teaching at Centre College in Danville, KY for a one year contract.  Thus, I'm on the market for a new job, starting summer 2024!  <b><a href="resume2023.pdf" target="_blank">Here is my resum&eacute;.</a></b>  Right now I am exploring different opportunities, but for the past year or so I have been preparing for a career in data science.</p>

		<h2>About this site</h2>
		<!--<p>I've got this site divided into three parts, linked above under my name.</p>-->
		<p>The Coding link at the top is about my coding experience, and is meant to supplement my resum&eacute;.  Since I've been looking at a career in data science, I thought this should be the most important part of this website.</p>
		<p>The Academia link gives an overview of two aspects of my experience in academia, teaching and research.  It's also a showcase of materials I've produced over the years during my time in academia.</p>
		<!--<p>Finally, the third part, Links, compiles some of the more important links that are scattered throughout the site, along with a few other links that I thought would be interesting.</p>-->

		<h2>Some links</h2>
		<p>This website is full of links to stuff I've done.  Here are some of the most important ones.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../Academia/WheelerCV.pdf">My CV (as of Dec 2023)</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/wh33les" target="_blank">My GitHub account</a>  
				<p>This is probably the most important link of all.  Total playground for me to practice code.  The files for this website are in the <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/wh33les.github.io" target="_blank">wh33les.github.io</a> repository.  The files for my coding blog are in the <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/Blog" target="_blank">Blog</a> repository.  Also has projects and exercises I've done with Erd&#246;s Institute, and teaching and research materials I've created using code.</p>
			</li>	
			<li>
				<a href="https://wh33les.github.io/Blog/" target="_blank">My coding blog</a>  
				<p>Posts about my journey learning code, and a few machine learning posts, too!</p>
			</li>

				<a href="https://wheeler.math.gatech.edu" target="_blank">My Georgia Tech website</a>  
				<p>Awful site-builder that was a pain to use, but at least I got the domain name I wanted.  There might've been a way to build the page from scratch, the way I prefer, but I never found out how.  The links to the courses I taught are just for the SY 2021-2022, because the pandemic was still going and I needed a place to put recordings of my lectures.  Then Georgia Tech sunsetted BlueJeans and switched to Zoom, so those lectures are no longer available (I did try to export all the videos but was never able to).</p>

				<p>YouTube playlist that is part of a series aimed at promoting early career mathematicians.  Hosted on my Mount Holyoke YouTube account.<!--g moving it to my personal YouTube account.  I'm afraid of losing this account since I'm no longer at Mount Holyoke.--></p>

				<p>Calculus I videos I made in spring of 2022.  I had the idea that I would eventually do graduate level topics, too (I'm dying to do a down-to-earth post on cohomology, for example).  We'll see.</p>
