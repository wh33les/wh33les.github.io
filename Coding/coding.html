		<h2>Coding notes</h2>
		<p>This page provides an overview of the programming languages I've worked with and my journey in learning them. <a href="https://wh33les.github.io/Blog/">Don’t forget to check out my blog!</a> I started blogging in the summer of 2017 after my contract at the University of Arkansas ended, focusing on basic computer science concepts like algorithms and data structures, which I implemented in C. I've continued to update the blog intermittently, especially during free time between teaching jobs.</p>
		<p>In Spring 2023, I began writing about my learning experiences with Python and JavaScript, from my studies at the Erd&#337;s Institute. You’ll also find posts on machine learning algorithms.</p>
		<p>You can view all of my coding projects on <a href="https://github.com/wh33les">my GitHub account.</a>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('python'); return false;">Python</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="python" class="hidden">
			<p>My first encounter with Python was in Spring 2018 through SageMath. While teaching a linear algebra with differential equations course at James Madison University, I wanted to provide students with visualizations like slope fields. I chose SageMath because, being Python-based, it seemed user-friendly and didn’t require installation, as it could be run on the cloud via CoCalc. <a href="THQ6LADiffEqspring2018.pdf">Here is an assignment where I used SageMath.</a></p>
			<p>I began seriously learning Python in Fall 2022 when I joined the Erdős Institute. Their data science boot camp included a series of Python preparation videos and a group data science project component. Since I missed the group project, I decided to tackle the boot camp project on my own the following February. I was amazed at how much Python I learned in just a month by referring to the boot camp lectures and Googling solutions. <a href="https://wh33les.github.io/538Project/ProblemStatement.html">Here is a script I wrote with minimal Python experience that scrapes metadata from featured posts on fivethirtyeight.com.</a> My rapid learning allowed me to demonstrate enough proficiency to secure a TA position for the May 2023 data science boot camp.</p>
			<p>I returned to Python for the May 2024 data science boot camp, where I submitted my "Do-nothing" Congress project. This project uses data from over 15,000 bills introduced in the 118th Congress to predict which will become law. <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/118thCongressProject">Here is the GitHub repository.</a></p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('htmlcss'); return false;">HTML/CSS</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="htmlcss" class="hidden">
			<p>I first learned HTML in a high school course. My next significant use of HTML was in college, where I created a website for a project on building a small radio telescope. Although the site no longer exists, I found <a href="http://www.olasu.com.uy/arch_contenidos/Radio_Astronomy_at_the_Backyard.pdf">a paper that cites it</a> and managed to locate <a href="KSU SRT Project.html">the source file.</a></p>
			<p>I didn't start using CSS until graduate school when I created my personal webpage <a href="gradschoolsite.html">(here’s the source file).</a> I further applied CSS while building <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/AcademiaMaterials/tree/main/ArkansasWebsite">my Arkansas website.</a></p>
			<p>During the data visualization mini-course project at the Erdős Institute, I learned best practices for writing HTML and CSS. You can see the improvements in coding style by comparing the source files mentioned above with the source for this website.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('javascript'); return false;">JavaScript</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="javascript" class="hidden">
			<p>I've been using JavaScript since grad school, mainly in small snippets found online to enhance my webpages. One ambitious attempt to use it was on my Arkansas website, where I wanted to display random pictures of my cats each time the page refreshed. While it didn’t quite work, you can still view the commented-out code in the <a href="index.html">Arkansas home page source file.</a></p>
			<p>My deeper dive into JavaScript began in April 2023 when I used the d3.js library on a data visualization project for the Erdős Institute's mini-course. You can view the <a href="https://wh33les.github.io/FitbitStatsProject/">final product,</a> with the files available in my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/FitbitStatsProject">FitbitStatsProject repository.</a>  I’ve also written a couple of blog posts about the experience.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is indeed everywhere! I discovered that MathJax, another JavaScript library, is essential for rendering LaTeX in my blog posts. I’ve also started incorporating JavaScript into this website, experimenting with different functionalities. While I’m aware that excessive use of JavaScript can slow down page loading times and may not be supported by all browsers, I believe using more JavaScript can give the site a contemporary feel.</p>
			<p>This summer I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491952024?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">Flanagan’s JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.</a> After reading the first 10 chapters, I’ve gained insights into object-oriented programming, client-side/frontend and server-side/backend programming, and have enhanced my understanding of Python classes. Now, I just need to put this knowledge into practice -- starting with this website!</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('r'); return false;">R</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="r" class="hidden">
			<p>I learned R while teaching an introductory statistics course at Centre College. The college provides an RStudio server with teaching materials used by other professors for the course. While customizing these documents for my lectures, I also learned how to compile LaTeX documents with embedded R code (.Rnw files), which allows the output of the R code to be included in the final document.</p>
			<p><a href="c29-Prediction_intervals-WheelerSp24.Rnw">You can see an example of a modified .Rnw file here,</a> which I used for one of my lectures. <a href="c29-Prediction_intervals-WheelerSp24.pdf">Here is the output file.</a></p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('latex'); return false;">$\LaTeX$</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="latex" class="hidden">
			<p>$\LaTeX$ is a powerful typesetting language widely used for rendering complex math equations and formatting academic papers, including those for AMS (American Mathematical Society) publication.</p>
			<p>I first learned $\LaTeX$ during my junior or senior year of undergraduate studies. I started by downloading a complete suite including MikTeX, which is the distribution and package manager, along with TeXnicCenter, a text editor with a compiler and a PDF preview feature. TeXnicCenter's built-in buttons for common LaTeX commands were particularly helpful for beginners.</p>
			<p>As I became more proficient with $\LaTeX$, I transitioned away from TeXnicCenter and began compiling documents directly from Notepad++ using MikTeX, and rendering PDFs with Sumatra PDF, a lightweight viewer.</p>
			<p>$\LaTeX$ has evolved over time, though some people still use its older incarnation, TeX, now called PlainTeX.  My Ph.D. advisor used PlainTeX for his lecture notes, so I aimed to replicate his style for my own grad school presentations. <a href="Proj3D.pdf">Here is an example of a talk I created using PlainTeX.</a></p>
			<p>In addition to typesetting, $\LaTeX$ supports creating posters and slide presentations. For instance, <a href="REU2022poster/REU2022poster.pdf">here is a poster that my students and I created.</a> $\LaTeX$’s Beamer document class is specifically designed for making presentations, allowing extensive customization of color schemes and layouts. <a href="UNABRIDGEDalgebraNotesMSRI-UP2016.pdf">Here is an example of group theory lectures I prepared in summer 2016.</a></p>
			<p>Lastly, $\LaTeX$ includes the TikZ package for creating graphics. While it has a learning curve, I invested time in mastering it during grad school. <a href="JMM2014.pdf">This talk</a> and the poster linked above showcase some of the graphics I've made with TikZ.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('m2'); return false;">Macaulay2</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="m2" class="hidden">
			<p>Macaulay2 (M2) is an open-source computer algebra system designed to work with Gröbner bases in its algorithms. It is available for download on FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac OS operating systems, but it does not support Windows natively.</p>
			<p>During my time in grad school, I used M2 with instructions for running it through Emacs via a Linux emulator. <a href="n5t3r4.pdf">Here is an example of a script I wrote in Emacs, including the outputs.</a></p>
			<p>With advancements in technology, Windows Subsystem for Linux now allows you to run M2 directly on Windows. I typically use M2 from the command line, but many users still prefer running it through Emacs.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('c'); return false;">C</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="c" class="hidden">
			<p>I first learned C programming during a college computer science course and excelled in it. In fact, my instructor mentioned that only one student had a grade higher than a C, and that student was me, with a remarkable 104% grade. Unfortunately, I didn't use C again after that course, although I worked with other C-based languages like Macaulay2 and MATLAB.</p>
			<p>In the summer of 2017, I decided to revisit C programming. This period also marked the creation of my GitHub account and blog. <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/PracticeAndLearning/tree/master/CProgrammingPractice">In my PracticeAndLearning repository, you’ll find several C-related files,</a> including two Markdown files with embedded images of C code I wrote.</p>

	<!--<div>
		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('markdown'); return false;">Markdown</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="markdown" class="hidden">
			<p>The first time I heard of Markdown was in 2009 when I worked for the <a href="https://www.msri.org/msri_ups/489">MSRI-UP</a>.  It was the first time I learned about Jupyter notebooks, too, but I can't remember what we were compiling on them.  The next time I used Markdown was in summer of 2017.  I'd learned how to do a lot back then, as you can see when you look at those Markdown files with the snippets of C that I posted above.  I started using Markdown again when I joined Erd&#246;s Institute.  Now I use it in Jupyter notebooks when I want to annotate Python I've written, and I use it for blog posts (I use a forked Jekyll Now repository for my blog -- see the README.md file in my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/Blog">Blog repository</a>).</p>
