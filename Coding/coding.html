		<p>This page just gives an overview of the languages I've used, and my history with learning them.  You can find more information on my <a href="https://wh33les.github.io/Blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> about learning code.  I started the blog in summer of 2017 when my contract at University of Arkansas ended and I was trying to learn basic computer science (algorithms, data structures) and implement what I was learning in C.  However, I lost my momentum when I got hired at James Madison University.  I picked it back up this past spring (2023) and started writing about what I've been learning, mainly Python and JavaScript, from <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Erd&#246;s Institute</a>.  I even have a few posts about machine learning algorithms!  You can find the code I've written for their projects and problem sets, among other things, on <a href="https://github.com/wh33les" target="_blank">my Github account</a>.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('latex'); return false;">LaTeX</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="latex" class="hidden">
			<p><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> is a typesetting language used to render math equations.  It is the standard for formatting math papers for publication (<a href="https://www.ams.org/home/page" target="_blank">AMS</a> has several packages).</p>
			<p>I first learned LaTeX in my junior or senior year of undergrad.  To use it, I downloaded an entire suite with <a href="https://miktex.org/" target="_blank">MikTeX</a>, which is the distribution, its package manager, and a program called <a href="https://www.texniccenter.org/" target="_blank">TeXnicCenter</a>, a text editor with a compiler and a preview of the pdf rendered.  What I liked about TeXnicCenter was that it had buttons for common LaTeX commands, and this is how I first learned them.</p>
			<p>However, as I got more familiar with LaTeX, I found that I no longer needed TeXnicCenter.  At one point during grad school, I found a way to write a script that would let me compile directly from <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> (with MikTeX installed), then render the pdf in the lightweight pdf viewer, <a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader" target="_blank">Sumatra PDF</a>.</p>
			<p>LaTeX has a few notable incarnations.  An earlier version exists, called TeX back when it was first implemented, and called PlainTeX now.  Until recent years, my Ph. D. advisor wrote all of his lecture notes using PlainTeX, so when I was giving talks at the student seminars in grad school, I wanted to make my lecture notes look like his.  <a href="Proj3D.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a talk I wrote using PlainTeX, and here is <a href="Proj3d.tex" target="_blank">its source</a>.</p>
			<p>LaTeX also has the capability to make posters and slide shows.  <a href="REU2022poster/REU2022poster.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a poster some students of mine and I made, and <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/wh33les.github.io/tree/main/Coding/REU2022poster" target="_blank">here</a> are the source files.  LaTeX has a document class called Beamer that is used to make slide shows.  The fun part is all the commands that customize the color scheme and layout.  It is also possible to combine slide shows into one big slide show.  <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/AcademiaMaterials/tree/main/CalcILectures" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example, of some calc I lectures I made at University of Arkansas.  <a href="cal1spr16Lectures.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is the final output.  This isn't the only time I've made lecture slides this way (see my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/AcademiaMaterials" target="_blank">AcademiaMaterials repository</a>).</p>
			<p>The final thing I will say about LaTeX is that it has a package called TikZ that is used for making graphics.  There's a bit of a learning curve to use it, but I spent some time learning some things when I was in grad school.  <a href="JMM2014.pdf" target="_blank">This talk</a> uses it a lot (sorry I don't have the source file anymore).  The poster I linked to above also uses it a bit.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('python'); return false;">Python</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="python" class="hidden">
			<p>Even though most of the Python I have learned has been recent, I first used it in spring of 2018 via <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.  I was teaching the linear algebra with differential equations course at JMU and I wanted to give the students visualizaitons like slope fields.  I chose SageMath because I thought being Python-based it would be easy to use, and SageMath doesn't require installation, it can be run on the cloud through <a href="https://cocalc.com/features/sage?utm_source=sagemath.org&utm_medium=landingpage" target="_blank">CoCalc</a>.  <a href="THQ6LADiffEqspring2018.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an assignment where I used Sage.</p>
			<p>I started to learn Python again when I joined Erd&#246;s Institute in fall of 2022.  For their data science boot camp there is a series of Python preparation videos that I watched, but I don't think I picked it up enough to be able to do many exercises from the boot camp.  I tried, but that semester I had a lot going on and couldn't really prioritize the boot camp, anyway.  The boot camp has a data science project component, to be done in groups.  Since I missed it, the following February I decided to try to do the boot camp project on my own.</p>
			<p>I was surprised at how much I was able to learn in just a month, just by referring to the boot camp lectures and Googling things.  I won't go into details here, but you can read about the project on my blog or look at the materials in my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/538Project" target="_blank">538Project repository</a>.  I learned so much Python in such a short period of time, that I was able to display enough proficiency to get a TA position for the May 2023 data science boot camp.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('htmlcss'); return false;">HTML/CSS</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="htmlcss" class="hidden">
			<p>I first learned HTML from a course I took in high school.  Then I think the next time I used it was for a website about this project I did in college where I was building a small radio telescope.  I don't think the site exists anymore, but when I tried to find it I found <a href="http://www.olasu.com.uy/arch_contenidos/Radio_Astronomy_at_the_Backyard.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> that cites it.  And I managed to find the <a href="KSU SRT Project.html" target="_blank">source file</a>.  I didn't realize that I had used a template.</p>
			<p>I don't think I learned about CSS until I made my personal page in grad school (<a href="gradschoolsite.html" target="_blank">here</a> is the source file), then I used it more on my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/AcademiaMaterials/tree/main/ArkansasWebsite" target="_blank">Arkansas website</a>.  
			<p>While doing the data visualization minicourse project from Erd&#246;s Institute I learned some best practices for writing HTML/CSS.  You can see the difference between the source files I posted above and the source for this website.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('javascript'); return false;">JavaScript</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="javascript" class="hidden">
			<p>I've used JavaScript since as early as grad school, but it's always been small snippets I found on the internet to make my webpages do certain things.  One ambitious thing I tried to do on my Arkansas website was to have pictures of my cats that change every time you refresh the page.  I never got it to work, and I think it's because at the time I didn't know you had to use a local server to render the JavaScript when you're editing the source file.  You can still see the code commented out on the Arkansas source file.</p>
			<p>I didn't really <i>learn</i> any JavaScript until April 2023 when I was using the library <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3.js</a> for the data visualization project.  <a href="https://wh33les.github.io/FitbitStatsProject/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the final product, the files are in my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/FitbitStatsProject" target="_blank">FitbitStatsProject repository</a>, and I also wrote a couple of blog posts about it.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is everywhere!  I found out recently that <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a> is another JavaScript library that I had to import to my blog site in order to render LaTeX in my posts.  I've found myself incorporating a little JavaScript in building this website, too.  In the future I would like to use this website as a means to practice and experiment using JavaScript.  Maybe it's not a good idea to use too much, since it can slow down page-loading time, if the viewer's browser even supports JavaScript.  On the other hand, I think using more JavaScript for this website could make it look more contemporary.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('m2'); return false;">Macaulay2</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="m2" class="hidden">
			<p><a href="http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/" target="_blank">Macaulay2 (M2)</a> is an open source computer algebra system that uses Gr&#246;bner bases in all of its algorithms.  It's available for download for FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac OS operating systems, but not Windows.  When I was in grad school the M2 site gave directions for running it through Emacs, through a Linux emulator.  <a href="n5t3r4.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a script I wrote through Emacs, with the outputs.  Nowadays Windows has the built-in emulator, Windows Subsystem for Linux, where you can run M2.  I always run M2 straight from the command line, but plenty of people I know still use Emacs.  I wish I could remember how to use Emacs.</p>
			<p>M2 is very well-documented, so it's not hard to get started using it.  However, I've only ever used it to run very basic scripts.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('c'); return false;">C</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="c" class="hidden">
			<p>I actually learned C when I took a computer science course in college, and I did well in it!  I remember at one point my instructor told the class that only one person had a grade that was higher than a C.  Guess who it was -- I had recently checked my grade and it was at 104%.  Unfortunately after that course I never needed to use C again.  I did use other languages that were C-based, though (M2 and Matlab).</p>
			<p>I decided to try to relearn C in summer of 2017.  This was also when I created my GitHub account.  The PracticeAndLearning repository has <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/PracticeAndLearning/tree/master/CProgrammingPractice" target="_blank">a few files</a> with C in them.  Two of them are Markdown files with embedded images of C that I wrote.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('r'); return false;">R</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="r" class="hidden">
			<p>I recently learned some R this past semester (Fall 2023) teaching Intro to Stats at Centre College.  For the course we ran R through Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio), where I learned about the Posit Cloud interface, as well as commands for linear regression, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.  The college also has an old RStudio server with teaching materials other professors at Centre have used for the course.  When modifying these documents for my own use I learned how to compile LaTeX documents with embedded R code that would print the output of the code when compiled (.Rnw files).</p>

		<h3><a href="#" onClick="toggleShowHide('markdown'); return false;">Markdown</a></h3>
		<hr>
		<div id="markdown" class="hidden">
			<p>The first time I heard of Markdown was in 2009 when I worked for the <a href="https://www.msri.org/msri_ups/489" target="_blank">MSRI-UP</a>.  It was the first time I learned about Jupyter notebooks, too, but I can't remember what we were compiling on them.  The next time I used Markdown was in summer of 2017.  I'd learned how to do a lot back then, as you can see when you look at those Markdown files with the snippets of C that I posted above.  I started using Markdown again when I joined Erd&#246;s Institute.  Now I use it in Jupyter notebooks when I want to annotate Python I've written, and I use it for blog posts (I use a forked Jekyll Now repository for my blog -- see the README.md file in my <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/Blog" target="_blank">Blog repository</a>).</p>
