I wanted to use React for the front end, so this mini-project is just me experimenting around learning it. The apps on this page go in increasing difficulty.</p></div><div class="bigdiv"><h2>(1) Tic tac toe tutorial</h2><hr/><p>This tic tac toe game is based on the React Tic Tac Toe Tutorial, <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe">found here.</a> At the end of the page on the React site, there is a list of suggestions for how to improve the game. Here are the suggestions, followed by a rendering of them all:</p><ol class="checklist"><li class="checked">For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.</li><li class="checked">Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.</li><li class="checked">Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.</li><li class="checked">When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).</li><li class="checked">Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.</li></ol><p></p><div class="jsapp" id="rootttt1"></div></div><div class="bigdiv"><h2>(2) My version</h2><hr/><p>Obviously I had to change the color scheme, sizing, spacing, etc! I also fixed the issue of the board moving on beginning game play. What did I do using React, specifically? Four things:</p><ol class="checklist"><li class="checked">Changed the way a win is indicated. The winning Xs or Os become bold and a circle is drawn around the winning row/column/diagonal.</li><li class="checked">Added sound effects: X play, O play, X win, O win, draw.</li><li class="checked">Added hover effects to empty squares (and the buttons).</li><li class="checked">Added an indicator of the current move when going back in time.</li></ol>Enjoy!<p></p><div class="jsapp" id="rootttt2"></div></div><div class="bigdiv"><h2>(3) Next level</h2><hr/><p>Here's where I took it to the next level -- a Connect Four game!</p><div class="jsapp" id="rootc4"></div></div></body></html>
