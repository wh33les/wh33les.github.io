		<h2>Academia</h2>
		<p>I am currently (spring 2023) finishing up a 2 year postdoc position at Georgia Tech.  <a href="https://wheeler.math.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Here</a> is my professional website.</p>
		<p>I got my Ph. D. in mathematics in 2014 from University of Michigan, under <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7693" target="_blank">Mel Hochster</a>.  My thesis topic was <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108987/wheeles_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y" target="_blank">ideals generated by principal minors</a>.  Since then I have held visiting (postdoc) positions at University of Arkansas (3 years), James Madison University (1 year), and Mount Holyoke College (3 years).</p>

		<h3>Teaching</h3>
		<p>Over the past 9 years, plus the time when I was in grad school, I have taught calc I-III, differential equations, survey of calculus (light calculus course at Arkansas), discrete math, group theory, ring theory, linear algebra with differential equations (JMU), intro and intermediate linear algebra, and commutative algebra (grad level).  I also taught a GRE prep course for the quantitaive reasoning portion of the exam, the summer after I graduated college.</p>
		<p>You can see some of my old teaching websites and materials by going to the <a href="https://github.com/wh33les/AcademiaMaterials/tree/main/ArkansasWebsite" target="_blank">ArkansasWebsite folder</a> in my GitHub repository, AcademiaMaterials.  For more recent materials, I don't think I had a website at JMU, and even though I did have a website at MHC it's gone now, and most of my materials were posted on Moodle, anyway.  At Georgia Tech I only created teaching websites for the SY 2021-2022 to post my recorded lectures (and now that Georgia Tech doesn't use BlueJeans anymore, the platform I used to make the videos, the lectures are no longer available).</p>
